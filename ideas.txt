items are cards

sword = +2 str, on use deal 6 dmg
wooden shield = +1 stamina, on use block 6

relic of the past = +5 mana, on use cast last 2 abilities

firebird = -5 hp each turn, on use Solarflare, deal 20 dmg to all enemies

leghunter = +2 all stats, 1dmg on kill get 10% of the str and hp of enemy




/// card item + 40 max hp
firebird really good idea actually

replace all item cards in hand with draws.
draw until hand full;

+1 mana next turn deal 4dmg
+1 dmg to every atk played this turn

see BUSH CHANCE



DANGER METER
risk of rain stiilis

each combat makes the risk meter go up,  raise mob stats by a litte, so we make the player not stay in one area too long
add some methods of healing, lifesteal too op

next damage you do is doubled

starting area boss, mid game? <-- release on this.
kapachow !!! ** 

each time played rare card, +1 damage.

debuff cards, DEAL 15dmg but, +1 to mana cost of all cards in hand
